# The Renter's Place
Apartment renting and managing website.


This project was made using C#, .NET and MSSQL server. It is the first 3 tier application that I post on here.

Basically, it's a school project that an apartment renting business could use to manage potential tenants accounts and apartment managers accounts.

Please let me know what you think!
